#boolean = T is true, F is false (if statements?)
# class "bool" short for boolean
#   and: compares two variables(bool), if both are true: true, false: false, true and false: false
#   not: flips (not a = b)
#   or: T + T = T, T+F = T, F+T = T, F+F = F (opposite of and)ca
#       all are operators^
# ORDER OF OPERATIONS: NOT>AND>OR
#comparison operators: >,<,>=,<=, == (EQUAL TO), != (NOT EQUAL TO), is
    #takes floats or ints and turns them into a boolean
    #comparisons take a higher precedence than boolean operations
#use comparisons to take care of floating point operations, try not to do comparisons with floats.
